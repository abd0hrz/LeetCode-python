"""
    Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the 
    minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. 
    If there isn't one, return 0 instead.
    
    Example: 
    Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem 
    constraint.
    
    Follow up:
    If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of 
    which the time complexity is O(n log n).

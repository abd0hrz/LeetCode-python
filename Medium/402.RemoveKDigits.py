'''
    Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, 
    remove k digits from the number so that the new number 
    is the smallest possible.

    Note:
        - The length of num is less than 10002 and will 
          be â‰¥ k.
        - The given num does not contain any leading zero.

    Example:
    Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
    Output: "1219"
    Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to 
                 form the new number 1219 which is the 
                 smallest.

    Example:
    Input: num = "10200", k = 1
    Output: "200"
    Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. 
                 Note that the output must not contain 
                 leading zeroes.

    Example:
    Input: num = "10", k = 2
    Output: "0"
    Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and 
                 it is left with nothing which is 0.

"""
    Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

    Example:
    Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
    Output: [1,2]

    Note:
        - You may assume k is always valid, 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ number of unique elements.
        - Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where 
          n is the array's size.
        - It's guaranteed that the answer is unique, in other words the set of 
          the top k frequent elements is unique.
        - You can return the answer in any order.

# September LeetCoding Challenge 2020
In this repository provided my Python solutions of September LeetCoding Challenge problems.

## Introduction
In this repository provided my Python solutions of September LeetCoding Challenge problems. 
- I highly recommend you to try and solve problems yourself before look at the solutions here.
- Solutions and approaches may be not optimal.
- All Solutions here are in Python 3.

## Notes
For the following problems I was googling approaches:
* <b>57\. <ins>Insert Interval</ins> (Hard)</b> - Was close to solve it on my own, but not. Main error: I was trying to do it in a given list and struggle with removing fully overlapped intervals.
* <b>421\. <ins>Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array</ins> (Medium)</b> - My first solution get `Memory Limit Exceeded`, second - `Time Limit Exceeded`. After several attempts I googled.
* <b>1041\. <ins>Robot Bounded In Circle</ins> (Medium)</b> - Watched how to optimize direction/position issue.
* <b>980\. <ins>Unique Paths III</ins> (Hard)</b> - Solved after watching several approaches/solutions.
* <b>399\. <ins>Evaluate Division</ins> (Medium)</b> - My solution passed 17/22 tests. I used one layer hashmap and it was the mistake. I wasn't be able to figure out what's wrong on my own.
* <b>713\. <ins>Subarray Product Less Than K</ins> (Medium)</b> - After several different solutions with `Time Limit Exceeded` status I watched how to optimize the best one. 
* <b>139\. <ins>Word Break</ins> (Medium)</b> - My solution get `Time Limit Exceeded`. Watched how to make it right.

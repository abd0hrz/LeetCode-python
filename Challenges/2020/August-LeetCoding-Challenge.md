# August LeetCoding Challenge 2020
Make Algorithms Great Again!

## Introduction
In this repository provided my Python solutions of August LeetCoding Challenge problems. 
- I highly recommend you to try and solve problems yourself before look at the solutions here.
- Solutions and approaches may be not optimal.
- All Solutions here are in Python 3.

## Notes
For the following problems I was googling approaches:
* <b>123\. <ins>Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III</ins> (Hard)</b> - Problem is really hard, req. strong understanding of Dynamic Programming. My own solution was not optimal. I was struggle with second buy/sell operation.
* <b>497\. <ins>Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles</ins> (Medium)</b> - Feels more like hard problem. Struggled with bisect. Solved after googled `bisect_right`.
* <b>983\. <ins>Minimum Cost For Tickets</ins> (Medium)</b> - This problem was super hard for me. I'll be honest, after several failed attempts I checked the solution. My approach was way far from correct.
* <b>952\. <ins>Largest Component Size by Common Factor</ins> (Hard)</b> - My approach was not far for correct, but I struggled with union find, so I googled. As conclusion, I think I couldn't finish it by myself.


Problem's question not clear*:
* <b>1032\. <ins>Stream of Characters</ins> (Hard)</b>  - In `query()` function every new query appends to the previous queries. Requests starts from latest and go to oldest.

_*Following problem's questions wasn't clear for me._

"""
    The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the 
    Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding 
    ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
    
        F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
        F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.
    
    Given N, calculate F(N).
    
    Example:
    Input: 4
    Output: 3
    Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.

    Note:
    0 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 30.

"""
    Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as 
    runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
    
    Return the running sum of nums.
    
    Example:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
    Output: [1,3,6,10]
    Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
    
    Constraints:
        - 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
        - -10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6

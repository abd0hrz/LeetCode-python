    Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space 
    characters ' ', return the length of last word (last word means the last 
    appearing word if we loop from left to right) in the string.
    If the last word does not exist, return 0.
    Note: A word is defined as a maximal substring consisting of non-space 
    characters only.

    Example:
    Input: "Hello World"
    Output: 5

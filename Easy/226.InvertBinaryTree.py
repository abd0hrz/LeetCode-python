"""
    Invert a binary tree.

    Example:
    Input:
             4
           /   \
          2     7
         / \   / \
        1   3 6   9

    Output:
             4
           /   \
          7     2
         / \   / \
        9   6 3   1

    Trivia:
    This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
        Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), 
        but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.
